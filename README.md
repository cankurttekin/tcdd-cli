This web tool helps you to find an empty seat in Turkish Railways by making requests to TCDD API from your browser.

## Features
Let's you choose date, stations and goes to loop to fetch empty seats and notify when seats > 0.
It uses ASCII BEL to notify when seats available so if you disabled terminal bell sound and want to get audio feedback you may need to enable it.

## Usage
```
# Go to project website:

```
